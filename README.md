# Web-based-interface-application-for-Insurance-Management-System
In this project, we have developed a web-based interface application for WDS insurance management company. In this website, users can register, login, buy an insurance policy and edit their existing insurance. 
<br/>
The code for this web development is written in PHP, a server-side scripting language that is called by the XAMPP web server and is connected to a relational database. PHP is a widelyused open-source language that is specifically used for web application development and canbe embedded within HTML. PHP can run on Windows, Linux, and UNIX servers. We use PHP because it can interact with many different database systems including Oracle and MySQL. The PHP script can access the MySQL database to retrieve all information about the web page. The procedure of setting up the MySQL database varies according to the localhost. Every database would require a user name and password in order to access the database. Database administration can be done using PHP scripts or using a program like PHPMyAdmin. We have created the WDS database and tables for storing the website information using
PHPMyAdmin.
